# Reflective Analysis: Community Gardens & Food Trees in Vancouver: Purpose, Limitations, and Choice in Layers and Styling
I created this map for individuals that are interested in sustainable food sourcing within cities (ie. Vancouver). The idea is that locations with a higher population should have more community gardens/food trees which should then maximize their opportunity to access these various food sources. As displayed on my map, although there are several local areas with densely populated food sources, there are also areas with none. This then raises the question of 1) whether the data was accurately gathered, 2) who decides where to start the next sustainable food source, and 3) how local areas without community gardens/food trees can gain access to one. Additionally, my final map is limited in multiple ways such as no title and no ‘tree’ located in the legend, using population instead of population density data, not labelling the local area names, unable to efficiently change the size and fonts of text, and more. Moreover, I believe that one major way to improve this map is to gather community garden/food tree data for the different major cities in the Metro Vancouver area and analyze the distribution of the food sources based on population density data. It would be interesting to investigate whether community gardens are located within areas of the affluent or areas of low socioeconomic class. I believe that it may be more beneficial for locations associated with lower incomes to have greater access to these food sources as a way of inexpensive grocery shopping, sustainable living, and sharing alternative ways of agricultural education to others in their community.

Regarding some of the layers and stylings that I chose for this assignment such as the base map – I did not gray it out because I wanted to provide context for the area surrounding my data as some users may need the additional information when interpreting my map. Thus, leading me to avoid using the colour green to symbolize the population data despite the overall context/theme of community gardens/food trees as the greenspaces were green. The decision to use the colour yellow was based on visual aesthetics as the different tones of yellow emphasized the population data while maintaining a relatively high position in the visual hierarchy. Furthermore, the choice to use the ‘tree’ icon over the ‘garden’ icon is because I thought that the ‘tree’ icon was more representative of food trees whereas the ‘garden’ icon was more reflected of a flower garden. However, I chose not to use green for the ‘tree’ icon as it would ruin the visual aesthetics of the overall map, whereas using black with a white halo continues to be representative of the data while maintaining its purpose – a data point. There was also the effect of zooming in on the icons – I really struggled through the process despite the ease of Mapbox studio. On my map, the icons increase in size depending on the zoom level but does not increase as smoothly as it could be thus decreasing some of interactivity on the map.

# Critiques & Help from Others
Some of the people that gave me critiques was Jassen Ongcol, Katherine Song, Lakshmi Soundarapandian, Rithikha Rajamonhan, and Angela Liu. The critiques consisted of not having pop-ups, changing the colour scheme, and labelling the local areas. I quite readily accepted these critiques as I agreed with their opinions and was able to tackle two out of the tree critiques. The one that I was unable to achieve was labelling the local areas as I believe that if I inserted the labels, it would muddle up my map and ruin the overall representation thus becoming less user friendly (ie. more difficult to distinguish what is more important with so many words and so many data points). Additionally, Rithikha Rajamonhan was the one that helped me with displaying my map and the legend; at the beginning, I could not get my access token to work and could not get my map to display at all, so she gave me a part of her code that was linked to my problem. Lakshmi Soundarapandian was the individual that gave me the total population data as I was unable to join the local area boundaries with the population data (due to my computer circumstances). And Jassen Ongcol was the one that helped me with styling the zoom range at the end for my icons.
